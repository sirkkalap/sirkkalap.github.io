            This is the public homepage for a developer. His name is Petri. He lives in Ylöjärvi, right beside his former hometown Tampere. He tests and writes code for his living in a company called Solita. While he has some time of his own he reads, codes, fiddles with photos, plays games or takes some photos of scenery and weather. Petri is very fond of technology and knows what makes the motorcycles tick in the way Phaedrus saw the world.</p>

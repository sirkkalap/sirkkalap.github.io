        <h1>A coder</h1>
        <p>This is the public homepage for a developer. He is called Petri. He lives in Ylöjärvi, right
            beside his former hometown Tampere. He writes code for his living in a company. The company is
            called Solita. While he has some time of his own he reads, codes, fiddles with photos, plays games or takes some new photos. Petri is very fond of technology and knows what makes the motorcycles tick and the way
            Phaedrus sees the world.</p>
